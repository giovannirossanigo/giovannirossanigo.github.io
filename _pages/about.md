# Giovanni Rossanigo
I am a PhD student in mathematics at the Universität Regensburg.
I am working under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Denis-Charles Cisinski. I am interested in higher category theory and its applications to derived algebraic geometry.
More precisely, I like to think about approximable structures for stable infinity-categories in the sense of Neeman and their properties.
