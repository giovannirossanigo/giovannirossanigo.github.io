In the summer semester 2025, Moritz Kerz group organized a seminar on étale cohomology, with the goal of proving Weil conjectures. 

The topic of my seminar was to compute the cohomology of curves over a separably closed field. 
You can find my notes [here](http://giovannirossanigo.github.io/files/Cohomology_of_Curves.pdf).
