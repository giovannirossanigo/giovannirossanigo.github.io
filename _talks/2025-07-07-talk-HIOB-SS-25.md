In the summer semester '25, the HIOB was organized by Tess Bouis, Niklas Kipp, and Sebastian Wolf. The topic was the recent construction of Berkovich motives developed by Scholze in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03382).  You can also fin [here](https://sfb-higher-invariants.app.uni-regensburg.de/index.php?title=HIOB_SS25) the program of the seminar. 

The goal of my talk was to prove that for a sufficiently nice arc-sheaf $X$ the $\inf$-category $D_{mot}(X)$ of motivic sheaves over $X$ is rigid over spectra. To do that, I gave a rapid overview of rigid $\inf$-categories and how they generalize rigidly-compactly generated categories.
