Amayrta and Robin have organized an online seminar whose goal is to understand Stefanich’s Tannaka duality statement, which refines Lurie’s result by eliminating the tameness hypotheses, by means of an affineness result. Here it is a [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04515) to  Stefanich paper, and here it is the [link](https://amartyasd.github.io/DAG1/) to Amyrta's page.


The topic of my talk was Grothendieck prestable $\inf$-categories, and [here]() you can find my notes. The material covered is essentially taken from Lurie's Spectral Algebraic Geometry, Appendix C.
