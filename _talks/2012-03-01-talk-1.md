 Our first goal is to study the dualizable objects for the Lurie tensor product on $PrLst$, the (∞, 1)-category of stable presentable (∞, 1)- categories and left adjoints. We show that the dualizable objects coincide with the compactly assembled (∞, 1)-categories. These are a suitable generalization of compactly generated (∞, 1)-categories, where the notion of “being generated under filtered colimits by compact objects” is replaced by “being generated under filtered colimits by compact exhaustible objects”. We then introduce rigid (∞, 1)-categories. We view them as presentably symmetric monoidal (∞, 1)-categories that are as close as they could be to being “rigidly-compactly generated” without being compactly generated. We finally discuss Scholze’s results: we show that for a sufficiently nice arc-sheaf X the (∞,1)-category Dmot(X) of motivic sheaves over X is rigidoverSp.WededucethenacategoricalversionoftheKu ̈nnethformula.
