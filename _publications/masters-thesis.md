In April 2025, I graduated from the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano. My thesis was conducted under the supervision of Professor Denis-Charles Cisinski (UR) and Professor Amnon Neeman (Unimi). 

Originally, the project consisted of producing $\infty$-categorical enhancements of two of Neeman's representability results (more precisely, the theorems in [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05777) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06471), now part of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02240)). In doing so, I ended up with two new theorems which have similar statements to those of Neeman. Even though the proofs rely on completely different methods, I wanted to give Neeman's name to them.
